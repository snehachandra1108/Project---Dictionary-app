This is a simple Dictionary Web App that allows users to search for words and retrieve their meanings, phonetics, audio pronunciation, synonyms, antonyms, and example sentences. The app uses the Free Dictionary API to fetch word details and displays them in a user-friendly interface.

I made this project as part of my trimester end submission project at my college

Features:

1.Search for any English word

2.View phonetic pronunciation

3.Listen to the word's pronunciation (if available)

4.Get part of speech details

5.View word definitions

6.See example sentences using the word

7.Display synonyms and antonyms (if available)

How It Works:

The app makes a request to the Dictionary API.

The response is processed, extracting key details such as:

*Word name

The extracted details are displayed on the web page.

If the word is not found, an error message is shown.
